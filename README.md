#### The Campaign:
The importance of organ donation can not be stated enough as the list of people waiting to recieve an organ is ever growing. Normalizing the conversation about organ donation and increasing organ donation registration is the ultimate goal. With these considerations in mind, the What Are You Waiting For? brand was developed.
